				<p class = "blog-post-text"> This assisgnment was fairly easy. The most difficult part was probably setting up and pushing it to the live server. The lectures and the code from class were by far the most helpful resources I used. Going through this assignment, it feels like HTML won't be the difficult part. At least with this assignment, it feels like HTML is easy, it's how you use it that's the difficult task. Organization is key. HTML gives you the tools to do so, but it's up to you to use them effectively. It's been fun learning how to use them. I'm very much looking forward to using CSS and javascript! CSS will be great to actually make a website that looks pretty! </p>

				<h3 class="blog-post-title"> Blog Post 2: assignment 2 </h3>
				<p class="blog-post-date"> 26 Oct 2020 </p>
				<p class="blog-post-text"> This assignment was challenging in a frustrating sort of way. I enjoyed working on it, but it was challenging to find the exact alignment option for the type of box I needed or wanted to use. Although the concept of the CSS box, with padding, margin, and border seems simple, when actually implementing them they were more difficult to mange than I had imagined they would be. 
				The lecture code, w3schools, and stackoverflow were great resources that I used for this assignment.
				I had this feeling throughout the assignment, that although I eventually got the element to behave how I wanted it to, there was a much better way of implementing the change that I wanted. Though, for a first real attempt with CSS, I think it turned out alright. Overall, it was very fun, apart from a few snags - mostly with alignment issues. I'm looking forward to bigger projects and javascript! </p>

				<h3 class="blog-post-title"> Blog Post 3: assignment 3 </h3>
				<p class="blog-post-date"> 16 Nov 2020 </p>
				<p class="blog-post-text"> This assignment was without a doubt much more difficult than the previous two. It was also much more satisfying to get things working since the things that were accomplished were a bit more in depth than the previous assignments. Learning how to select different things within javascript was an experience in the least. It took some time to begin to get the hang of it. I still have a feeling that for some things, there is a much easier way than the way I used. Piazza was definitely useful for help with the filtering portion. When I could submit criteria to filter, my for-loop would only iterate through exactly half of the post elements. I couldn't figure out why it was happening until I went and saw someone else had a similar issue. I felt a bit silly since it was a simple issue, but I'm not sure how long it would've taken to find it myself. Probably a much much longer time! </p>
