		<p> This assisgnment was fairly easy. The most difficult part was probably setting up and pushing it to the live server. The lectures and the code from class were by far the most helpful resources I used. Going through
		this assignment, it feels like HTML won't be the difficult part. At least with this assignment, it feels like HTML is easy, it's how you use it that's the difficult task. Organization is key. HTML gives you the tools to do so, but it's up to you to use them effectively. It's been fun learning how to use them. I'm very much looking forward to using CSS and javascript! CSS will be great to actually make a website that looks pretty! </p>
