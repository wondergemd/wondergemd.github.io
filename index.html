		<h3> What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills? </h3>
		<p> I've have nearly no expirience in web development, so the most complex thing I've done with web development skills is editing the embedded code on my old myspace page. Though, I'm not sure if that counts. </p>

		<h3> What do you hope to learn from this class? </h3>
		<p> I'm quite interested in web development, so I hope to get the foundational skills needed for a possible career path in web development. At the least, I hope to learn the skills needed to create a competent personal website. </p>

		<h3> Have you signed up for our course Piazza forum? </h3>
		<p> Yes, I have! </p>

		<h3> A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had. </h3>
		<p> I have heterochromia, meaning my eyes are blue, brown, and green. </p>
